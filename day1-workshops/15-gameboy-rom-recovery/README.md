Howdy y'all!

These are the slides for my R2Con 2024 workshop on extracting the boot
ROM of the Nintendo Game Boy from a photograph of its CPU.  Students
were given two hours to complete the extraction, with the slides
offering a quick overview of the process before a walkthrough by the
instructor.

Students begin with two files:

1. [MaskRomTool](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool),
either built from source or installed from a recent
[release](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/releases).
v2024-08-18 was used for this workshop.

2. [gbrom-tutorial](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/gbrom-tutorial)
provides the image, `dmg01cpurom.bmp`.

To repeat this workshop without an instructor, follow instructions in
the second repository's README file.
